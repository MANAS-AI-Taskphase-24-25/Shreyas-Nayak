# Task 8.0 -  Lord of the Strides

## Description
It's that time of the year again, Timothy is excited to see the bunch that has made it to the final task in the preliminary Taskphase and is throwing a party to his fellow friends(the descendants of those whose teeth you classified).<br>
But he needs help feeding the right kind of stuff to the right dino, can you help him out?

### Overview
Timothy has the pictures of the teeth samples collected though, the only hurdle is to  classify those pictures as belonging to their respective dinos.


### Implementation

Build a CNN to predict which class the image from the dataset belongs to.<br>
You are allowed to use torch/tensorflow-keras to build the model, no pretrained models are allowed though.<br>
Timothy is a visual learner, so he needs to see visualizations like confusion matrices, predictions, and graphs before he can trust your code.<br>

<br>
<br>
Use the dataset attached to train your CNN, the dataset also contains vacation pictures, make sure to classify them as well .<br>
