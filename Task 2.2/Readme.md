# Task 2.2 - Bonus Task

## Description

After thrashing other teams at IGVC 2024, we quickly got down to work on the new design for our ground vehicle, but since we manufacture everything in-house,
it falls on us to make the best use of resources. So we needed predictions for the Quality Rating of the produced items because repeated
and uncertain testing just takes a toll on what we can and cannot source in-house.

There are two csv files given, Seniors.csv and Juniors.csv. The Seniors.csv file contains the quality rating of the various tests that were done by our seniors ,
and the Juniors.csv file, contains the parameters/conditions that we want to test our models under. Juniors.csv does not contain the Quality rating,
you just have to predict the values and save the output as a csv file.
